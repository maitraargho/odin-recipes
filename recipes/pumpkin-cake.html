    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong><em>This recipe for a delicious pumpkin cake is baked in a sheet pan. It's lightly spiced, very moist, and great for potlucks. When cool, top with your favorite cream cheese frosting.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Pumpkin cake freezes well and is a great way to get a head start on your fall baking. Wrap the cooled, unfrosted cake in at least one layer of storage wrap and at least one layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months.</p>
