## Self Reflections

> A very easy and nice little project wherein I learned about the use of HTML elements and tags, the HTML boilerplate, how to work with text, lists, links and images, and the proper way to write git commit messages.

> An update: I've added a bit of CSS to make it look better than the previous iteration. I've learned quite a bit again: from adding different selectors, grouping and chaining selectors, descendant combinators, to adding several properties related to color, background color, typography properties, etc. I've also made sure to take care of the CSS cascade, inheritance and rule order.
