# odin-recipes
A Basic Recipe Website

## Description

This project[^1] shows a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page with links to three recipes.

***This project will no longer be worked upon.***[^2]

[^1]: This is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

[^2]: There is no point to work more on this project because the [TOP strategy guide](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) highlights that projects in the [foundations aren't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Foundations%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20strong%20portfolio%20generator) and [only the capstone might be worth spending extra time on](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Always%20spend%20extra%20time%20on%20capstone%20projects).

## Self Reflections

> A very easy and nice little project wherein I learned about the use of HTML elements and tags, the HTML boilerplate, how to work with text, lists, links and images, and the proper way to write git commit messages.

> An update: I've added a bit of CSS to make it look better than the previous iteration. I've learned quite a bit again: from adding different selectors, grouping and chaining selectors, descendant combinators, to adding several properties related to color, background color, typography properties, etc. I've also made sure to take care of the CSS cascade, inheritance and rule order.

> Another update: I changed the look and feel of the website for a second time. I learnt about inspecting HTML and CSS using the chrome developer tools and liked the concept behind both the standard and alternative CSS box models. I also loved the idea of using divs and spans to add a bit of flair to the website. I definitely went overboard and tried to creep in more css by adding rounded corners and stuff. One of the tools that helped me to check my HTML code was the [W3C's markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
